# Compare 2 NBA players!

## Description

We created a website so that users will be able to search any NBA player and retrieve their stats, a bio about that player, and other achievements. Users are presented with two search boxes that will either give a list of names to choose from, if they put a first or last name, or automatically load the chosen player they search. They can refresh the page with the home button inside of the nav or clear their search with the clear button under the text boc. We used the wiki api and an api that pulls request from the NBA's official website.
